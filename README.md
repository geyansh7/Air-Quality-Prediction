# Air-Quality-Prediction
 **GOAL**
The goal of this project is to predict Air Quality Index (AQI ) form features as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitric Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3) etc.

__WHAT I HAD DONE__
Step 1: Data Exploration
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Step 3: Data visualization
Step 4: Data training
Step 5: Model Creation
Step 6: Performance Evaluation

__MODELS USED__
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Decision Tree Regressor

__LIBRARIES NEEDED__
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)

__CONCLUSION__
By using Linear Regression model
   Accuracy achieved :  78.71
By using Lasso Regression model
   Accuracy achieved :  78.71
By using Ridge Regression model
   Accuracy achieved :  78.71
By using Decision Tree Regressor model
   Accuracy achieved :  99.91
Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, lasso regression and rigde regression is almost same.

Whereas accuracy of decision tree regressor is higher and root mean sqaure error is least.

Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
